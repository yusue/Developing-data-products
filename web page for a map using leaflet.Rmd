## Introduction
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Here, I am going to show the map of National University of Singapore.

## My first map
```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
NUS = c("<a href= 'http://www.nus.edu.sg/' >National University of Singapore</a>")

map = leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lng=103.7764,lat=1.2966, popup=NUS)

map    
```
